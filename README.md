# 12-employee-database

## Description

This app is designed to add, view, and search through entries in a database. This project was designed to show my ability to work with mySQL in a node.js program. This app solves the problem of
maintaining an employee database through a CLI app. While creating this program, I learned how to use mySQL to enter and retrieve data from a database. 

## Installation

To install this program, download the code from this repo and use a terminal to work from the folder. You will need to make sure that you have mySQL and node.js installed on your machine.
In the downloaded folder, you will need to run "npm i" in a terminal to install all the dependcies needed for the app. Then run "node assets/js/index.js" to start the program.

## Usage

Once the program starts, You will be asked a series of questions through the terminal that will give you the ability to enter employee information. When an option is done, you will be
brought back to the main menu.

Here is a video showing the program running with all of the options: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mNjmvIZLYvqRuwWpjDtq03XBdreA3-ku/view
